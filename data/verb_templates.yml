# first try: all templates will be unmodified indicative active
  # "transformations" will modify 
    # verb tense, mood, voice, etc.
    # nouns via adjectives, particples, etc.
    # combine clauses

# not totally sure whether to redo this for every semantic category...

# too annoying - have to deal with direct address (no article!) and, if sticking with 你好, pronouns too.

  # tags up here are purely syntactic

      template: S V O .

# ugh, make this one form per language, and save alternate forms for transformations? (like O, V S for "add emphasis")
  # otherwise, you'd have to keep track right here about which template goes with which, across all languages
  # WARNING: this could be problematic if there are many equivalent forms in a single language...
  # TODO: if i'm not accessing raw data directly, it's only SLIGHTLY less convenient to use list?
    # bleh, let's postpone as much complexity as possible and just see what's the minimal code it takes to get this working

# oh, one "template" for each semantic category? or should I tag them with categories instead?
  # the latter sounds like more typing in the long run... but then you don't have to figure out file locations...
    # or should you split into multiple files? but then you have to copy/paste the SVO info
  # BUT if you tag each verbset individually, you also have to retag the O/S constraints. let's not do that for now.

# okay, so without any transformations, V(en) needs to choose between VBP and VBZ, but V(zh) does not.
  # special case: be(I) = am|VBZ1(perhaps)
  # transformations need to set flags that "the system" would execute?
  # ideally, morphology rules would be set in data instead of algorithms, to maximize portability...

  
# sentence templates and verbs (+ arguments) are inseparable; they are both multilingually banked in the same file 
  
# proposal: all verbs in each semantic category can be modified with the same PP set.
semantics:

- id: action.possession
  # TODO: PP-style modifications, before all verbs in the set - probably with an example
  
  # semantic constraints on (the head word of) S, O. TODO: allow override on per-verb basis?
  tags:
    O:
    S: # could make this "entity", but what about figurative uses?
    
  verbsets:
  - example: Alice has cookies .
    en: have
    zh: 有
    
  # well, generator needs to have knowledge about who is S and who is O in order to decline/inflect nouns...
