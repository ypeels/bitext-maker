# a multilingual file synsets.yml and a separate file nouns_en.yml
# - this way, morphological information can be shared between all (possibly many!) senses of a word 
# - also, this way, inflection-rich languages won't clutter up synsets.yml 

# penn treebank tags
# NN: noun, singular (or mass)
# NNS: noun, plural (default: NN+s)

# any words whose morphology changes with meaning can be marked with extra tags
