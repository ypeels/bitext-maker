# first try: all templates will be unmodified indicative active
  # "transformations" will modify 
    # verb tense, mood, voice, etc.
    # nouns via adjectives, particples, etc.
    # combine clauses

# not totally sure whether to redo this for every semantic category...

example: Alice|S kicks|V Bob|O .
 
symbols:
  - id: V
    type: verb
    description: main verb
    
  - id: S
    type: NP
    description: subject
    
  - id: O
    type: NP
    description: object
    





# oh, one "template" for each semantic category? or should I tag them with categories instead?
  # the latter sounds like more typing in the long run... BUT then you don't have to figure out file locations...
    # or should you split into multiple files? but then you have to copy/paste the SVO info

# okay, so without any transformations, V(en) needs to choose between VBP and VBZ, but V(zh) does not.
  # special case: be(I) = am|VBZ1(perhaps)
  # transformations need to set flags that "the system" would execute?
  # ideally, morphology rules would be set in data instead of algorithms, to maximize portability...
