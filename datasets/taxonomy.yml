# noun category taxonomy

# TODO: tags, like [divisible]? (important for English - "eat the hot dog" vs. "eat food")
  # alternative: multiple taxonomies, as "high up" as possible - e.g., indivisible: animal
    # but then you'd have to make 2 passes through the file to mark all animals as indivisible - use isa()
    # oh wait, you can just check the genealogy for all REGISTERED ancestors, not just for yourself (see code)

# oh boy, tree order matters...?#
# I used this tag to mean "countable" in generator, and it's hard-coded everywhere...
    
# it looks like my (horrible) multi-tree scheme works, but only if all items live in only TWO TREES at most?

# this is included to test "canbe" - this tag should be able to be added to any noun, since it places no restrictions.
# it still remains to check that nouns satisfying all these tags actually exist, though
