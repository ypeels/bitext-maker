# noun category taxonomy

# TODO: tags, like [divisible]? (important for English - "eat the hot dog" vs. "eat food")
  # alternative: multiple taxonomies, as "high up" as possible - e.g., indivisible: animal
    # but then you'd have to make 2 passes through the file to mark all animals as indivisible - use isa()
    # oh wait, you can just check the genealogy for all REGISTERED ancestors, not just for yourself (see code)
