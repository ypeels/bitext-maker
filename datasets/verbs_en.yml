# n.b. pyyaml cannot write comments back to file (duh - parser discards them)

#VB:     # infinitive
#VBD:    # past
#VBG:    # present participle
#VBN:    # past participle - he had VBN the O
#VBP:    # present - we now VBP the car
#VBZ:    # present 3-sing - he now VBZ the car
__verb__:
  VBD: 
  VBG: 
  VBN: 
  VBP: 
  VBZ: 
  
# COULD use references, but that would add an annoying extra key to EVERY entry...
# unused? isn't it easier to just check each verb for an "irregular" key? well, doesn't hurt to have this info...
__regular__:
  VBP1: VBP
  VBD1: VBD
  VBD3: VBD

# making things a big long list instead of multiple documents for now
# - don't see a compelling reason to use multiple documents per file right now, other than maybe indentation
# - this way, can use references between words if needed (on its own line, to get the whole list item)
