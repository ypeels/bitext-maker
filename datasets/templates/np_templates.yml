# TODO: pronoun - n.b. a nonlocal dependency may have to be wired up externally
# TODO: VP-NP - like gerunds or infinitives. I guess you could have a single symbol and punt to its template??
  # also tag as "action" or maybe "verb" - since it can't be used EVERYWHERE, semantically (*the cat in the kicking)
  # OR better, I should write out the full template here, and then transformations would TRANSDUCE symbols
  # better still (since you don't want to write out ALL possible verb templates here), write down the transform here somehow
    # e.g. for participle, start with Clause and turn one of the NPs into a target/slot
  # n.b. infinitives don't take determiners, but gerunds MIGHT ("the killing")
# TODO: subgroups for conjunctions? but they're only weird as subjects... "The taco and flying a bike"
# TODO: custom templates 
# TODO: PP's - hmm, those belong in transformations, maybe stored in some kind of nounset file?

# TODO: "C" - e.g., "Let's go to the mall" was a bad thing to say. Or is that a meta transformation?
