# TODO: NOT SCALABLE WITH # LANGUAGES! would need to combine multiple entries into one for scalability
  # still, this is not QUITE as problematic, since the set of "polymorphic" meta verbs is relatively small...right?
# add overrides to verbsets to blacklist/whitelist additional options
  # transformations take place at the template level, but verbsets enter at the lexical level
  # right now, lexical level only varies after the template has been FIXED
  # workaround: new verb category, but use YAML references to keep data DRY, overriding/adding keys as needed
