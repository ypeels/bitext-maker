    # note that these are already kind of transformation-like, since they are not part of the original template

# add overrides to verbsets to blacklist/whitelist additional options
  # transformations take place at the template level, but verbsets enter at the lexical level
  # right now, lexical level only varies after the template has been FIXED
  # workaround: new verb category, but use YAML references to keep data DRY, overriding/adding keys as needed
