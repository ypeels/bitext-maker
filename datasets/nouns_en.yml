# a multilingual file synsets.yml and a separate file nouns_en.yml
# - this way, morphological information can be shared between all (possibly many!) senses of a word 
# - also, this way, inflection-rich languages won't clutter up synsets.yml 

# penn treebank tags
# NN: noun, singular (or mass)
# NNS: noun, plural (default: NN+s)

# TODO: noun templates, which you need to generate non-compositional semantic tags like "last night #past"
  # funny noun phrases could go here

man: 
  NNS: men
  
person: 
  NNS: people # TODO: "persons", as in "persons of interest"

# it's tempting to delete these entries, but a blank entry confirms that somebody has done and checked the data input
right:

thing:
  
time:
  
# any words whose morphology changes with meaning can be marked with extra tags
